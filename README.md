# Monty

###### The goal of this project is to create a monty ByteCodes files interpreter

# Learning Objectives

## General

##### What do LIFO and FIFO mean

##### What is a stack, and when to use it

##### What is a queue, and when to use it

##### What are the common implementations of stacks and queues

##### What are the most common use cases of stacks and queues

##### What is the proper way to use global variables

## Challenges

## Own understanding

#### What I have learnt from teh project is that monty bytecode contains the instructions from which we will use to manipulate our stacks and queues programs. We will read the contents of the moty files from our c code and open the monty files and reaad the opcode that will be used to determine if we push,pop or the data used in our stacks and queues
